## The Long Depression (1873‑1879)

### Key Economic Triggers & Indicators
- **Trigger**: The collapse of Jay Cooke & Company, a major investment bank heavily invested in railroad securities, on September 18, 1873.
- **Bank failures**: A chain reaction of bank runs and failures across the United States and Europe, temporarily closing the New York Stock Exchange.
- **Business failures**: Approximately 18,000 businesses went bankrupt between 1873 and 1878, including 89 of the nation's 364 railroads.
- **Unemployment**: The unemployment rate peaked at about 14% in 1876, with one‑quarter of New York City's labor force jobless in the winter of 1873‑1874.
- **Deflation**: A prolonged period of falling prices (deflation) as money supply contracted and demand collapsed.
- **International context**: The crisis began with stock‑market crashes in Vienna, Austria, leading European investors to sell American securities, which drained gold reserves and tightened credit.

### Government Response
- **Monetary policy**: Congress attempted to ease monetary conditions with the **Inflation Bill of 1874**, which would have injected additional greenbacks into circulation, but President Ulysses S. Grant vetoed it.
- **Fiscal stance**: The federal government maintained a **laissez‑faire approach**; there was no large‑scale relief program for the unemployed or direct aid to failing businesses.
- **Presidential actions**: President Grant’s administration focused on maintaining the gold standard and resisting inflationary measures, believing the economy would self‑correct.
- **State‑level responses**: Some states and cities set up charity boards and public‑works projects, but these were limited and ad‑hoc.
- **Labor unrest**: Widespread strikes (e.g., the Great Railroad Strike of 1877) prompted President Rutherford B. Hayes to deploy federal troops, marking one of the first major federal interventions in labor disputes.

### Impact on Common People
- **Employment and wages**: Millions of workers lost jobs; those who remained employed faced repeated wage cuts, leading to widespread poverty.
- **Homelessness and hunger**: With no social safety net, many families were evicted and relied on soup kitchens and private charity.
- **Social mobility**: The depression widened the gap between industrial capitalists and laborers, hardening class divisions.
- **Migration**: Some unemployed workers became itinerant “tramps,” riding freight trains in search of work, while others moved westward in hopes of finding agricultural or mining opportunities.
- **Racial disparity**: African‑Americans, especially in the South, suffered disproportionately as falling cotton prices and the end of Reconstruction erased earlier economic gains.

### Long‑Term Societal & Governmental Changes
- **End of Reconstruction**: The depression shifted national attention away from Southern Reconstruction, allowing the “Compromise of 1877” and the withdrawal of federal troops, which ended efforts to protect African‑American civil rights.
- **Labor movement growth**: The hardship fueled the rise of organized labor (e.g., the Knights of Labor) and socialist movements, pushing for an eight‑hour workday and better working conditions.
- **Regulatory precedents**: Although no major federal regulatory agency emerged directly, the crisis highlighted the need for a more stable banking system, foreshadowing later reforms such as the Federal Reserve (1913).
- **Economic thought**: The Long Depression challenged the prevailing belief in laissez‑faire economics and spurred debates about the role of government in managing business cycles.
- **Cultural impact**: The period produced a lasting literary and artistic theme of hardship and class struggle, exemplified by writers like Mark Twain (who coined the term “Gilded Age” for the era’s superficial prosperity masking deep problems).
