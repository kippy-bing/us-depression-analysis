# U.S. Economic Depression Analysis Project

A structured, collaborative analysis of three major U.S. economic depressions. This project uses GitHub workflows to organize research, simulate collaborative review, and build a well-documented historical analysis.

## Project Description

This repository aims to provide a comparative study of three significant economic depressions in United States history:
1. **The Panic of 1837** (1837–1840s)
2. **The Long Depression** (1873–1879)
3. **The Great Depression** (1929–1939)

The analysis focuses not only on economic data but also on governmental responses, societal impacts, and long-term changes that emerged from each crisis. The project is designed to be collaborative, with issues tracking research tasks and pull requests formalizing contributions.

## Analysis Template

Each depression will be analyzed according to the following standardized template:

### Key Economic Triggers & Indicators
- Bank failures, credit crunches, stock market crashes
- Deflation/inflation trends
- Unemployment rates and business closures
- International economic context (if applicable)

### Government Response
- Legislation passed (or failed)
- Monetary and fiscal policies
- Presidential/administrative actions (or inaction)
- Role of the Federal Reserve (post‑1913)

### Impact on Common People
- Employment and wage changes
- Housing and homelessness
- Social mobility and inequality
- Migration patterns (e.g., Dust Bowl, urbanization)

### Long‑Term Societal & Governmental Changes
- New laws, regulatory agencies, or reforms
- Shifts in political ideology (e.g., New Deal liberalism)
- Changes in public trust in institutions
- Legacy on subsequent economic thought and policy
